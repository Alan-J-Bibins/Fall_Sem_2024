## Topics commonly asked:
1. Find time complexity
2. Recursive functions - Three methods
3. Stack - infix prefix postfix conversion + alg/reverse elements + alg
4. Queue - Circular Queue demonstration + alg
5. Sorting - algs / Modify alg for specific condition/ identify alg
6. Trees - BST algs/Generic tree to Binary tree/Expression trees
7. BFS/DFS - demonstration/write alg
8. Dijkstras - demonstration
9. Hashing - given hash function, based off of two options
10. Heaps - Min heap/ max heap demonstration + operations (deletion/insertion)
11. AVL Trees - insertion/deletion/balancing

# OKKK, we have 5 hrs, and i dont feel confident, plan of action:
- Recurrence relation: 3 methods
- Expression trees
- Stack: Infix,postfix,blah blah & tower of hanoi
- Queue: Circular Queue
- Dijkstras alg
- BST - operations
